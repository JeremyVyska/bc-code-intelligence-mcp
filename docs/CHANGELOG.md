## [Unreleased]

### ‚ú® Added - Git Layer Diagnostics (Advanced Users Only)
- **Optional Diagnostic Tools**: New `developer.enable_diagnostic_tools` config flag (default: false)
- **Reduces Token Overhead**: Diagnostic tools only load when explicitly enabled (saves ~1000 tokens per request)
- **Git Authentication Testing**: `diagnose_git_layer` tool for Azure DevOps PAT troubleshooting
- **Local Layer Diagnostics**: `diagnose_local_layer` tool for troubleshooting project override layers
- **Layer Validation**: `validate_layer_config` and `get_layer_diagnostics` for configuration debugging
- **Azure DevOps Support**: `test_azure_devops_pat` specifically for Azure DevOps authentication issues
- **Hot Reload**: `reload_layers` command to reload layers after config changes WITHOUT restarting MCP
- **Environment Variable**: Set `BC_CODE_INTEL_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=true` to enable

**6 Diagnostic Tools Total:**
1. `diagnose_git_layer` - Comprehensive git auth & connectivity testing
2. `test_azure_devops_pat` - Azure DevOps PAT validation
3. `diagnose_local_layer` - Local layer path, permissions, and content validation
4. `get_layer_diagnostics` - Layer status and performance metrics
5. `validate_layer_config` - Configuration file validation (planned)
6. `reload_layers` - Reload layers after config changes (no restart needed!)

**Local Layer Diagnostics Features:**
- Path existence and accessibility checks
- Permission validation (read/write)
- Content discovery (markdown file counting)
- Subdirectory structure validation (domains/, topics/, overrides/)
- Sample markdown frontmatter validation
- Specific recommendations for each failure type

**Reload Layers Features:**
- Reload configuration file dynamically
- Refresh layer cache without MCP restart
- Reload specific layer or all layers
- Shows updated topic counts and load status
- Perfect for testing configuration changes iteratively

**To enable diagnostic tools:**
```yaml
# In bc-code-intel-config.yaml
developer:
  enable_diagnostic_tools: true
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export BC_CODE_INTEL_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=true
```

This adds 2 specialized tools for Chris Config to diagnose git layer authentication issues without adding token overhead for users who don't use layers.

## [1.4.4] - 2025-10-16

### üêõ Bug Fixes - Issue #17: Token-Based Specialist Auto-Detection

#### Fixed - Specialist Discovery for Complex/Compound Queries
- **Token-Based Matching**: Implemented intelligent query tokenization for specialist discovery
  - Queries now split into individual keywords for matching (e.g., "review" matches "code-review")
  - Bidirectional partial matching: tokens match field substrings and vice versa
  - Short words (‚â§3 characters) filtered out for better precision
  - Applied across all specialist discovery services: `roleplay-engine.ts`, `multi-content-layer-service.ts`, `specialist-discovery.ts`

- **Improved Confidence Scoring**: Lowered threshold from 0.3 to 0.15
  - Specialists now match with fewer keyword hits (more permissive)
  - Still filters irrelevant results (e.g., "weather forecast" returns no BC specialists)
  - Granular scoring: 0.15 for primary expertise, 0.10 for secondary, 0.05 for domains

- **Enhanced Query Robustness**: 
  - Handles compound queries: "code review standards compliance naming conventions error handling"
  - Handles punctuation and special characters gracefully
  - Case-insensitive matching across all query variations
  - Very long queries (50+ words) work correctly

#### Fixed - Core Tools Now Work with Natural Language
- **`ask_bc_expert`**: No longer throws "No suitable specialist found" for compound queries
  - Previously: Required exact substring matches
  - Now: Token-based matching finds appropriate specialists for complex questions
  
- **`suggest_specialist`**: Returns relevant specialists with proper confidence scores
  - Previously: Empty results for multi-term queries
  - Now: Suggests Roger Reviewer, Dean Debug, Eva Errors correctly based on keywords

- **`get_specialist_advice`**: Auto-detection improved via better specialist discovery
  - Works seamlessly with natural language queries
  - Finds specialists even when query contains multiple domain-specific terms

#### Added - Comprehensive Integration Tests
- **`tests/integration/specialist-auto-detection.test.ts`**: 17 new integration tests (all passing)
  - Token-based matching validation (6 tests)
  - Confidence calculation validation (5 tests)
  - Edge cases and robustness (4 tests)
  - End-to-end integration (2 tests)
  - Validates exact scenarios from Issue #17 bug report

#### Impact
- **Usability**: AI agents can now use natural, compound questions with `ask_bc_expert`
- **Discovery**: Specialist suggestions work with multi-domain queries
- **Reliability**: No more "No suitable specialist found" errors for valid queries
- **GitHub Copilot**: Improved integration with natural language queries

### üîß Technical Changes
- Modified: `src/services/roleplay-engine.ts` - `calculateSpecialistConfidence()` now uses token matching
- Modified: `src/services/multi-content-layer-service.ts` - `matchesSpecialistQuery()` tokenizes queries
- Modified: `src/services/specialist-discovery.ts` - `analyzeSpecialistMatch()` implements token-based scoring
- Added: `tests/integration/specialist-auto-detection.test.ts` - 17 comprehensive tests

  - Added null safety checks in `specialist-discovery.ts` for `expertise.primary`, `expertise.secondary`, and `domains` arrays
  - Added null safety checks in `specialist-loader.ts` for `suggestSpecialist()` and `getSpecialistsByDomain()` methods
  - Added null safety check in `multi-content-layer-service.ts` for `supported_content_types` array
- **Company Layer Queries**: Company-specific knowledge now loads and surfaces correctly when using company context phrases
  - Domain content from company knowledge layers now properly retrieved via `searchTopics()`
  - Specialist queries no longer crash when company layer specialists have undefined metadata fields

#### Added - Comprehensive Integration Tests
- **Real Knowledge Validation**: Tests that validate actual knowledge loading (not mocks)
  - `tests/integration/real-knowledge-validation.test.ts` - Validates real specialists and topics load from embedded-knowledge
  - Tests edge cases with incomplete specialist metadata without crashing
  - Validates performance requirements with real data
- **Company Layer Loading**: Complete scenario testing for custom company knowledge
  - `tests/integration/company-layer-loading.test.ts` - 16 tests validating company knowledge layers
  - Creates sample company layer with custom domain topics and specialist overrides
  - Validates domain content surfaces when searched ("myPartner naming conventions" scenario)
  - Tests graceful degradation and error recovery with missing metadata

#### Impact
- Users can now successfully use company-specific knowledge layers without crashes
- Queries like "Using [company name] company standards, [question]" now work as intended
