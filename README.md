## 🤝 New to AI-Assisted Development? Start with Parker

If you're not sure how to work with AI tools, or you're skeptical about letting AI touch your code—**that's exactly why Parker exists**.

Parker is a grizzled veteran who helps you work WITH AI safely:
- Creates **reviewable proposals** instead of making direct changes
- **Explains AI reasoning** so you understand what's happening and why
- **Coordinates other specialists** to validate suggestions before you commit
- Builds trust **gradually** through transparency and verification

**Just say:**
- "Parker, I'm new to AI development tools. Help me understand how this works."
- "Parker, I don't trust AI to write my code. What's a safe way to start?"
- "Parker, review what the AI just suggested before I accept it."

Once you're comfortable, you can work directly with any specialist—but Parker's always there when you want that extra layer of verification and explanation.
