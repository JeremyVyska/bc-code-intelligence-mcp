```al
codeunit 50100 "Sales Order Processor"
{
    procedure ProcessOrder(SalesHeader: Record "Sales Header")
    var
        SalesLine: Record "Sales Line";
    begin
        SalesLine.SetRange("Document Type", SalesHeader."Document Type");
        SalesLine.SetRange("Document No.", SalesHeader."No.");
        if SalesLine.FindSet then
            repeat
                // Process each line
                ProcessSalesLine(SalesLine);
            until SalesLine.Next = 0;
    end;
}
```

**User:** "Can you review this code for performance and best practices?"

**Claude with BCKB Integration:**

I'll analyze your sales order processing code using Business Central best practices.

### Code Analysis Results:

**Issues Found:**

   - **Suggestion**: Consider using ModifyAll when appropriate for field updates
   - **Related Topics**: "Bulk Data Operations in AL", "Performance Optimization Patterns"

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **BEST PRACTICE** - Error handling missing
   - **Description**: No error handling for failed line processing
   - **Suggestion**: Add try-catch blocks or validation checks
   - **Related Topics**: "Error Handling in AL", "Transaction Management"

### Pattern Analysis:
- ‚úÖ Proper use of SetRange for filtering
- ‚úÖ FindSet pattern correctly implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider adding security and permission checks

  - Bulk operation alternatives

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Batch Processing Implementation** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Process multiple lines in transactions
   - Related Topics: "Transaction Scope Management", "Batch Processing Patterns"

### Contextual Suggestions:
- Run complete code analysis for the full codeunit
- Check related posting routines for consistency
- Review error handling patterns across your extension
- Consider implementing progress indicators for large datasets

**Enhanced Code Example:**
```al
codeunit 50100 "Sales Order Processor"
{
    procedure ProcessOrder(SalesHeader: Record "Sales Header")
    var
        SalesLine: Record "Sales Line";
        ProcessingError: Text;
    begin
        SalesLine.SetRange("Document Type", SalesHeader."Document Type");
        SalesLine.SetRange("Document No.", SalesHeader."No.");

        if not SalesLine.FindSet then
            exit;

        repeat
            Clear(ProcessingError);
            if not TryProcessSalesLine(SalesLine, ProcessingError) then
                LogError(SalesLine, ProcessingError);
        until SalesLine.Next = 0;
    end;

    [TryFunction]
    local procedure TryProcessSalesLine(var SalesLine: Record "Sales Line"; var ErrorText: Text): Boolean
    begin
        // Your processing logic here
        // Return false if processing fails
    end;
}
```

## Example 3: Architecture Decision Support

**User:** "I need to integrate Business Central with an external API. What's the best approach for real-time data synchronization?"

**Claude with BCKB Integration:**

For Business Central API integration with real-time synchronization, here are the recommended architectural approaches:

### Primary Architecture Options:

1. **Event-Driven Integration** (Recommended)
   - Use BC webhooks + external API callbacks
   - Minimal latency, efficient resource usage
   - Best for: High-frequency updates, critical data sync

2. **Scheduled Batch Processing**
   - Job queue-based synchronization
   - Predictable load, easier error recovery
   - Best for: Large datasets, non-critical timing

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Real-time for critical transactions
   - Batch for bulk/historical data
   - Best for: Complex integration scenarios

### Knowledge Supplements from BCKB:
- **Topic**: "API Integration Patterns in Business Central" (Advanced)
  - REST API consumption best practices
  - Authentication and security patterns
  - Rate limiting and retry logic

- **Topic**: "Webhook Implementation Guide" (Expert)
  - Setting up BC webhooks
  - External system callback handling
  - Error handling and recovery strategies

- **Topic**: "Job Queue Management" (Intermediate)
  - Scheduled processing patterns
  - Error handling in background jobs
  - Performance monitoring techniques

### Implementation Recommendations:

**For Real-Time Requirements:**
```al
// Event subscriber example
[EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Table, Database::"Sales Header", 'OnAfterInsertEvent', '', false, false)]
local procedure OnSalesHeaderInsert(var Rec: Record "Sales Header")
begin
    // Trigger immediate API sync
    SendToExternalAPI(Rec);
end;
```

**For Batch Processing:**
```al
// Job queue codeunit pattern
codeunit 50200 "API Sync Job"
{
    procedure SyncPendingRecords()
    var
        SyncQueue: Record "API Sync Queue";
    begin
        // Process queued items
        ProcessSyncQueue(SyncQueue);
    end;
}
```

### Suggested Actions:
- Define your sync requirements (latency, volume, criticality)
- Set up webhook endpoints on the external system
- Implement error logging and retry mechanisms
- Create monitoring dashboards for sync status
- Plan for offline scenarios and conflict resolution

### Performance Considerations:
- API rate limiting strategies
- Bulk operation optimization
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing patterns

### Security Best Practices:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication implementation
- API key rotation strategies
- Data encryption in transit
- Audit trail for all API interactions
